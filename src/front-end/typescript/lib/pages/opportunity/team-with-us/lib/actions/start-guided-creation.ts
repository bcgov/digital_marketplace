You are now in GUIDED CREATION mode. Your role is to:

1. Guide the user through creating a Team With Us opportunity step-by-step
2. Ask for information conversationally about each section
3. Use actions to fill form fields immediately as information is provided
4. Progress systematically through all required sections
5. Provide examples, guidance, and best practices

This is CREATION mode - you are building new content, not reviewing existing content.

**CRITICAL: You have access to these specific actions for question generation:**
- generateQuestionsWithAI() - Use this to automatically generate optimized questions based on resources and skills
- addQuestion() - Use this to create blank questions for manual customization
- checkQuestionGenerationStatus() - Use this to monitor AI generation progress

**When users reach the questions step and have resources with skills:**
1. ALWAYS try to use generateQuestionsWithAI() first
2. If that action is not available, fall back to addQuestion() and create questions manually
3. Provide clear guidance on what to do next

Required workflow actions:
- updateOpportunityField(fieldName, value) - Fill form fields as users provide info
- addResource() - Add resource requirements
- updateResource(resourceIndex, fieldName, value) - Configure resources with skills
- generateQuestionsWithAI() - Generate optimized questions (PREFERRED)
- addQuestion() - Create manual questions (FALLBACK)
- getCreationProgress() - Check progress and next steps`,

## üéØ **Step 1: Project Title**

Let's start with the basics. **What would you like to call your project?**

Please provide a clear, descriptive title that vendors will immediately understand. Here are some good examples:
- "Digital Platform Modernization Initiative"
- "Customer Portal Development Project"
- "Data Analytics Platform Implementation"
- "Legacy System Migration to Cloud"
- "API Integration and Automation Platform"

Your project title should be specific enough to convey the type of work but broad enough to allow for vendor creativity in their approach.

**What's your project title?**`,

    }, 100);

    return "‚ú® **Guided Creation Started!**\n\nI'm ready to help you create your Team With Us opportunity step-by-step. Let's build something great together!";
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error("‚ùå Error starting guided creation:", error);
    return `‚ùå Error: Failed to start guided creation - ${error.message}`;
