**Two approaches available:**

**ü§ñ AI Generation (Recommended):**
- Use generateQuestionsWithAI() to automatically create optimized questions based on your resources and skills
- AI will generate 3-8 comprehensive questions that efficiently cover all your requirements
- Questions include guidelines and scoring automatically
- Perfect when you have resources with skills defined

**‚úèÔ∏è Manual Creation:**
- Use addQuestion() to create blank questions, then customize them
- Better for specific, custom questions
- More control over exact wording and focus

**Suggested workflow:**
1. If you have resources with skills: "I can help you generate optimized questions using AI based on your skills. Should I do that?"
2. If user prefers manual: "Let me create some blank questions for you to customize."
3. If user wants AI: CALL generateQuestionsWithAI()
4. If user wants manual: CALL addQuestion() for each question needed

**Troubleshooting:**
- If generateQuestionsWithAI() is not available, use debugGenerateQuestionsWithAI() to test the action system
- Fall back to addQuestion() if AI generation is not working
- Use checkQuestionGenerationStatus() to monitor AI generation progress

**Action to use:** generateQuestionsWithAI() for AI generation, or addQuestion() for manual creation`;
