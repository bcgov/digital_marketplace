/**
 * Exports all HTTP client functions to make requests to the
 * Digital Marketplace back-end server. Each function is organized by
 * resource and generally follows CRUD-naming conventions.
 *
 * @example
 * Since this module re-exports all client functions, you should
 * only import this module and not import the child modules directly.
 * This module also re-exports some helper functions and types to deal
 * with responses, like the {@link ResponseValidation} type.
 * ```ts
 * import * as api from "front-end/lib/http/api";
 * import { Cmd } from "front-end/lib/framework";
 * import { User } from "shared/lib/resources/user";
 *
 * type Msg = ADT<"gotUser", api.ResponseValidation<User, string[]>>;
 *
 * const getUserCmd: Cmd<Msg> =
 *   api.users.readOne()("userId", response => adt("gotUser", response));
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * Due to limitations with the TypeScript compiler, the client functions
 * have been implemented inside "thunks" to enable better type inference.
 * In practice, this means you may need to make an extra function call
 * to use a client function, but this allows you to concretely set the type
 * parameter for what the resulting {@link Cmd} returns.
 * ```ts
 * import * as api from "front-end/lib/http/api";
 * import { User } from "shared/lib/resources/user";
 *
 * // Notice the <Msg> concrete type and the extra function call.
 * const getUserCmd =
 *   api.users.readOne<Msg>()("userId", response => adt("gotUser", response));
 * ```
