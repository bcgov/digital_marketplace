The Code With Us (CWU) opportunity page will require several details from you to ensure a clear and fulsome procurement with the vendor community. The following outlines the required sections and the level and kinds of detail required.

## The Overview Tab

Teaser – This is a short summary of what your project is about and is limited to 500 characters. The purpose of this is to, at a glance, grab the attention of the vendor community and pique their interest.

Remote OK? – If No – The expectation is that the vendor will be working on site.

If Yes - Remote Description – (If Yes was selected for Remote Ok?) – This identifies any caveats that may apply to a Remote work contract. Here are three options as examples:

- Meet once in person every two weeks
- Must be available in Prince George if requested
- No in-person required

Fixed-Price Award – This section identifies the amount you are offering the vendor for completion of the project. It is important to note that with CWU, this is a fixed amount and will be paid in full to the vendor upon completion of the project or paid in a phase approach as indicated in the opportunity.

Required Skills – Here you can identify one or more skills that you require vendors to possess to complete the project. If you do not see the skill that you are looking for, you may create a new skill by entering it into the field directly.

## The Description Tab

In this section you will provide details around the following:

- Who you are? Ministry, Division, Branch. Provide the vendor with an understanding of who they will be working for.
- The Background of the project. What work, if any, has been done in this space in the past? Is this a net new project, or is this a continuation of previous efforts?
- What work are you expecting the vendor to complete? This will explain, in detail, the level of effort and the extent of work required from the vendor in order to complete the project. This will fully explain all aspects of the project and all deliverables that must be completed in order for the vendor to fulfill their responsibilities for the contract.
